Motor vehicle crashes are another major safety hazard on construction sites. It is important to be cautious while operation motor vehicles or equipment on the site. Motor vehicles should have a service brake system, emergency brake system, and a parking brake system. All vehicles must be equipped with an audible warning system if the operator chooses to use it. Vehicles must have windows and doors, power windshield wipers, and have a clear view of site from the rear window. All employees should be properly trained before using motor vehicles and the equipment.
<br>
<br>
Employees on construction sites also need to be aware of dangers on the ground. The hazards of cables running across roadways were often seen, until cable ramp equipment was invented to protect hoses and other equipment which had to be laid out.Other hazards found on construction site includes: asbestos, solvents, noise, and manual handling activities.
<br>
<br>
onstruction workers need to be properly trained and educated on the task or job before working, which will assist in preventing injuries and deaths. There are many methods on training construction workers. One method is coaching construction site foremen to include safety in their daily verbal exchanges with workers to reduce work-related accidents.It is important that the workers use the same speaking language to assure for the best communication. In recent years, apart from traditional face to face safety knowledge sharing, the popularity of mobile apps make knowledge sharing through apps possible 
<br>
<br>
Another method is that all workers know how to properly work and use electronics, conveyors, skid-steer, trucks, aerial lifts, and other equipment on the construction site.Also, equipment on the job site must be properly maintain and inspected regularly before and after each shift.The equipment inspection system will help the operator to make sure that the machine is mechanically sound and in safe operating conditions.
